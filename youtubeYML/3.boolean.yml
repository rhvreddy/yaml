# In YAML, boolean values represent the concept of true or false. Boolean values are often used to express conditions, options, or states in configuration files, data structures, and other contexts.
#Boolean values in YAML are represented using the following syntax:
# . true: Represents the true value.
# . false: Represents the false value.

deploy: true  ## here in this case it will deploy, because as we gave "true"
test: false  ## here in this case it will not test, because as we have "false"

active: true
admin: false
