# In YAML, dictionaries (also knows as maps, objects, or associative arrays) are used to store collections of key-value pairs. Dictionaries allow you to associate keys with corresponding values, similar to how objects work in programming languages. Dictionaries are a powerful way to represent structured data with named fields.

# Dictionaries in YAML are represented using key-value pairs within curly braces ( ). The keys are stings, and they are followed by a colon ; and the associated value.
